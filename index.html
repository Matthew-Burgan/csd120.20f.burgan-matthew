    <h1>Welcome to Matthew Burgan's CSD120 Website </h1>
    Hi my name is Matthew I decided to take this program at sault college cause I really enjoy working with Computers and I enjoyed the coding I did in highscool alot and im excited to see what I can learn and accomplish from this course.
    Some of my favorite things to do when im not busy with schoolwork is hangout with friends and go walking with them. I also Enjoy magic the gathering the card game and just the usual video games.
